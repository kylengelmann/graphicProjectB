# Northwestern Intermediate Graphics 
## Project B: Ray-Tracing
To see the project running, go to https://kylengelmann.github.io/graphicsProjectB/

This project uses ray-tracing in order to generate an image. Since Ray-Tracing is a time-expensive process, the image is split into to windows, a WebGL preview window on the left, and a ray-traced image on the right.

The ray-traced image has user enabled/disable anti-alliasing, multiple materials, procederally generated textures, and stochastic sampling for soft shadows.
